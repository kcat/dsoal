# DSOAL

This project is for a DirectSound DLL replacement. It implements the
DirectSound interfaces by translating the calls to OpenAL, and fools
applications into thinking there is a hardware accelerated sound device. EAX is
also implemented (up to version 4) by using OpenAL's EAX extension, allowing
for environmental reverb with sound obstruction and occlusion effects.

Effectively, this allows DirectSound applications to enable their DirectSound3D
acceleration path, and turn on EAX. The actual processing is being done by
OpenAL with no hardware acceleration requirement, allowing it to work on
systems where audio acceleration is not otherwise available.

Or more succinctly: it enables DirectSound3D surround sound and EAX for systems
without the requisite hardware.


## Source Code

To build the source, you will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 2.6 or newer.
You can either use the CMake GUI, specifying the directories for the source and
where the build files should go, or using one of the command-line programs, for
example by first making sure to be in an empty directory where the build files
will go (such as the provided build/ sub-directory) and running cmake with the
path to the source.

Once successfully built, it should have created dsound.dll.


## Usage

Once built, copy dsound.dll to the same location as the desired application's
executable. You must also provide an OpenAL DLL in the same location, named as
dsoal-aldrv.dll, or else the DLL will fail to work. Some applications may need
to be configured to use DirectSound3D acceleration and EAX, but it otherwise
goes to work the next time the application is run.

Source releases and Windows binaries for OpenAL Soft are
available at its [homepage](https://openal-soft.org/).
Instructions are also provided there.

Users on Windows 8 and above may need to add certain DirectSound registry keys for the DLL to work: [dsound.zip](https://github.com/kcat/dsoal/files/10252285/dsound.zip)

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be set:
- `DSOAL_LOGLEVEL`:
  - Values: Integer, range `0-3`
  - Description: Set the verbosity of DSOAL logging. Level 3 enables logging of API traces. By default, a log level of `1` is used to report errors only.
- `DSOAL_LOGFILE`:
  - Values: String
  - Description: Path to a file that will be created/overwritten by DSOAL on each execution. All logging will be redirected to that file. If unset, logging it written to the process's `stderr` output.
